### Professional Profile
[cite_start]I am a **Robotics and AI Engineer** driven by the goal of using technology to make the world a little better[cite: 2, 25]. [cite_start]I specialize in bridging the gap between hardware and digital code, with a core focus on building reliable and scalable software for autonomous systems[cite: 69, 78]. 

[cite_start]Currently, I am a Master's student at **Syddansk Universitet (SDU)** in Odense, Denmark, specializing in Advanced Robotics Technology [cite: 60-62]. [cite_start]My current research for my Master's Thesis focuses on **Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Neural Networks**[cite: 70]. [cite_start]Specifically, I am using **Evidential Deep Learning** in PyTorch to explore how robots can be made safer and more reliable when utilizing AI for decision-making[cite: 71].

### Research & Work Experience
My background includes hands-on experience in both industrial and research environments:
* [cite_start]**SDU (HospiBot Project):** As a Robot Programmer, I worked on robotic mobile platforms for hospitals, focusing on PID controller reliability and developing image-based recognition pipelines for human-robot interaction [cite: 33-39].
* [cite_start]**e Talgo:** Developed a Python-based testing tool from scratch to monitor train system responses using UDP and TCP sockets [cite: 41-45].
* [cite_start]**Siemens:** Gained experience in CNC programming and mechanical design using SINUMERIK and Siemens NX [cite: 52-57].

### Skills & Interests
[cite_start]I am proficient in **Python, C++, ROS/ROS2, and PyTorch** [cite: 17-21]. [cite_start]Beyond engineering, I have a deep passion for languages and culture—I am fluent in English (IELTS 8), passed the JLPT N4 in Japanese, and am currently learning Danish to better connect with the community in Odense[cite: 10, 11, 15, 27, 94]. 

[cite_start]When I'm not coding, I value *hygge*, enjoy a good book, play the guitar, and love hearing different perspectives on the world through cozy meet-ups with friends [cite: 28-30, 49].
